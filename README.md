# AURA (Codename): AI–Quantum Hybrid Command Core for Next-Gen Missile Defense

**Author:** Milo Vinson  
**Date:** May 2025

---

## Overview

AURA proposes a neural command core that fuses real-time AI inference (GPU-based) with quantum optimization techniques to create an adaptive, learning-based missile defense system. Designed for modern threat environments—including hypersonic missiles, swarm drones, and multi-domain adversaries—AURA evolves with every engagement.

This repository contains the original concept paper describing AURA's architecture, use cases, deployment strategy, and technical stack.
