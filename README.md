## Overview

AURA proposes a neural command core that fuses real-time AI inference (GPU-based) with quantum optimization techniques to create an adaptive, learning-based missile defense system. Designed for modern threat environmentsâ€”including hypersonic missiles, drone swarms, and multi-domain adversariesâ€”AURA evolves with every engagement.

This repository contains the concept paper describing AURA's system architecture, use cases, technology stack, and deployment model.
